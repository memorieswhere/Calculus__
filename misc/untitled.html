                <strong>Calculus</strong>, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the
                study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; differential calculus concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while
                integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. As the names suggest, differential calculus is simply the study of derivatives of functions, while integral calculus is the study of
                integrals.

                Calculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, actuarial science, computer science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine, demography, and in other fields wherever a problem can be mathematically
                modeled and an optimal solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the other.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                Physics makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in classical mechanics and electromagnetism are related through calculus. The mass of an object of known density, the moment of inertia of objects, and the potential
                energies due to gravitational and electromagnetic forces can all be found by the use of calculus. An example of the use of calculus in mechanics is Newton's second law of motion, which states that the derivative of an
                object's momentum with respect to time equals the net force upon it. Alternatively, Newton's second law can be expressed by saying that the net force is equal to the object's mass times its acceleration, which is the time
                derivative of velocity and thus the second time derivative of spatial position. Starting from knowing how an object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and Einstein's theory of general relativity are also expressed in the language of differential calculus. Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and in studying
                radioactive decay. In biology, population dynamics starts with reproduction and death rates to model population changes.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                Green's theorem, which gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a planimeter, which is
                used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing. For example, it can be used to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of
                property.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                In the realm of medicine, calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow.Calculus can be applied to understand how quickly a drug is eliminated from a body or how quickly a
                cancerous tumour grows.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                In economics, calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily calculate both marginal cost and marginal revenue.

                The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of differentiating a function (calculating the gradient) with the concept of integrating a function (calculating the area under the curve). It
                establishes that differentiation and integration have an inverse relationship, in other words, they are inverse operations of each other.

            <p1>If \(\color{black}f\) be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval \(\color{black}[a, b]\), then the function defined as</p1>

            <p1>is continuous on \(\color{black}[a, b]\) and differentiable on the open interval \(\color{black}(a, b)\), and</p1>

            <p1>The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute a definite integral when the antiderivative of its integrand is known.</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 4px;">
                Let \(\color{black}f\) be a real-valued function on a closed interval \(\color{black}[a, b]\) and \(\color{black}F\) a continuous function on \(\color{black}[a, b]\), which is an antiderivative of \(\color{black}f\), such
                that
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \color{black}F'(x) = f(x) \quad \text{ or } \quad F(x) = \int f(x) + C\)</p1>

            <p1>If \(\color{black}f\) is Riemann-integrable on \(\color{black}[a, b]\), then</p1>
            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \int_{a}^b f(x)\ dx = F(b) - F(a)\)</p1>
            <p1>stating that the integral of \(\color{black}f\) over the interval \(\color{black}[a, b]\) is equal to [the antiderivative evaluated at \(\color{black}b\)] - [the antiderivative evaluated at \(\color{black}a\)].</p1>
            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">The theorem can also be equivalently expressed as</p1>
            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \int_{a}^b f(x)\ dx = F(x) \Big|_a^b\)</p1>
            <p1>
                Where the vertical bar with the intervals of integration \(\color{black}a\) and \(\color{black}b\) as subscript and superscripts is called the evaluation bar. The evaluation bar in this case means to evaluate
                \(\color{black}F(x)\) at \(\color{black}x = b\) and \(\color{black}x = a\) such that \(\color{black}F(b) - F(a)\). <br />
                The theorem again, can also be equivalently expressed as
            </p1>
            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \int_{a}^b f(x)\ dx = F(x) \Big]_a^b\)</p1>
            <p1>
                which rather than the vertical bar, use the square bracket. The same idea applies nonetheless, just slightly different notation. All three mentioned expressions of the theorem are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.

                A function is said to be continuous at a point \(\color{black}{c}\) if its graph can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page at \(\color{black}{c}\). If this is not possible, that is you must lift
                the pencil up then down again to trace the function, then it is discontinuous at that point. Continuity can be thought of as the property of a function that allows it to be "smooth" and connected, without sudden jumps or
                breaks in its graph.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 7px;">
                A <g>continuous function</g> is a function that has no abrupt changes in value &mdash;&mdash; known as discontinuities, throughout its domain. The class of functions that qualifies as being continuous are; but not limited
                to; polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and power functions.

                There are several concepts in Calculus that relies on the assumption that the function is continuous. Some of which includes:
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 20px;">
                &mdash; The definition of the derivative: The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the size of the interval approaches zero. This definition relies on the function being
                continuous at the point in question, because the limit only exists if the function is continuous.
                <br />
                <br />
                &mdash; The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: This theorem states that the definite integral of a function over a given interval can be found by evaluating the function at the endpoints of the interval and taking the
                difference. This theorem relies on the function being continuous over the interval in question, because the definite integral is only defined for continuous functions.
                <br />
                <br />
                &mdash; The Mean Value Theorem: This theorem states that if a function is continuous on an interval and differentiable on the interior of the interval, then there exists at least one point in the interval where the
                derivative of the function is equal to the slope of the secant line through the two endpoints of the interval. This theorem relies on the function being continuous and differentiable on the interval in question.
                <br />
                <br />
                &mdash; The Intermediate Value Theorem: This theorem states that if a function is continuous on an interval and takes on two different values at the endpoints of the interval, then it must take on all values between those
                two endpoints at some point in the interval. This theorem relies on the function being continuous on the interval in question.
                <br />
                <br />
                &mdash; The Extreme Value Theorem: The extreme value theorem states that every continuous function on a closed, bounded interval has a maximum and minimum value on that interval. The extreme value theorem relies on the
                concept of continuity, as it requires that the function be continuous over the entire interval. If the function is discontinuous at any point within the interval, the theorem may not be applicable or may not have a
                well-defined result.

            <p1>To determine whether a function is continuous at a given point \(\color{black}{x = c}\), ensure that the three conditions <i>i, ii,</i> and <i>iii</i> are all satisfied at \(\color{black}{x = c}\).</p1>
            <p1 style="padding-top: 4px;">
                The strategy is to check whether conditions <i>i</i> and <i>ii</i> are satisfied before testing for condition <i>iii</i>. If that is not the case, it can be concluded that the function is discontinuous at \(\color{black}{x =
                c}\) and is unnecessary to go any further.
            </p1>
            <p1 style="margin-left: 37px; padding-top: 3px;">
                1.) Check if \(\color{black}{f(c)}\) is defined or if \(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x\to c}f(x)}\) exists; if \(\color{black}{f(c)}\) is undefined or if \(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x\to c}f(x)}\) does not
                exist, we can conclude the function is discontinuous at that point and go no further.
                <br />
                2.) <i>If and only if</i> \(\color{black}{f(c)}\) is defined and \(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x\to c}f(x)}\) exists, confirm the equality between \(\color{black}{f(c)}\) and \(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x\to
                c}f(x)}\). If \(\color{black}{f(c)} \neq \) \(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x\to c}f(x)}\), then the function is discontinuous at \(\color{black}{x = c}\)

                Below are examples providing detailed steps on determining continuity of a function \(\color{black}{f(x)}\) at \(\color{black}{x = c}\) and identifying the type of discontinuity. The type of discontinuity can be identified

                    \(\color{black}]0, 10[\)
                </li>

                    A <g>half-open</g>, <g>half-closed</g>, <g>semi-open</g>, or <g>semi-closed</g> interval includes only one of its endpoints, and is denoted by mixing the notations for open and closed intervals; e.g. \(\color{black}(0,

                <li>
                    The interior of an interval \(\color{black}I\) is the largest open interval that is contained in \(\color{black}I\); it is also the set of points in \(\color{black}I\) which are not endpoints of \(\color{black}I\).
                </li>

            <br />

            <p1>
                A function is continuous on an open interval if the interval is contained in the domain of the function, and the function is continuous at every point of the interval. A function that is continuous on the interval
                \(\displaystyle \color{black}{(-\infty ,+\infty )}\) (the whole real line) is often called simply a continuous function; one says also that such a function is <i>continuous everywhere</i> or continuous over its entire
                domain. For example, all polynomial functions are continuous everywhere.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 6px;">
                A function is continuous on a semi-open or a closed interval, if the interval is contained in the domain of the function, and the function is continuous at every interior point of the interval, and the value of the function
                at each endpoint is the limit of the values of the function when the variable tends to the endpoint from the interior of the interval.

            <p1 style="padding-top: 2px;">
                That is, the last condition for a continuous on a closed interval as mentioned is that if we were given some function \(\color{black}f(x)\) that is continuous on a closed interval \(\color{black}[a, b]\), then it follows

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 4px;">
                Every differentiable function must also be continuous; if \(\color{black}f\) is differentiable at \(\color{black}x = c\), then \(\color{black}f\) must also be continuous at \(\color{black}x = c\)
            </p1>

            <p1>
                However, the converse of these two propositions does not hold; continuity does not imply differentiability. Consider the absolute value function \(\color{black}f(x) = |x|\) as an example. \(\color{black}f(x)\) is continuous
                but is not differentiable; although \(\color{black}f(x)\) is continuous at every point in its domain, its not differentiable at \(\color{black}x = 0\) since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left

                The intermediate value theorem does not assert at which point the function will take on a given value; it only guarantees the existence of such a value. The theorem asserts that if a function is continuous on a closed
                interval, it must take on all values between its endpoints at some point in the interval. This seems intuitively reasonable since a continuous function can be thought of as a smooth curve, and that the curve must pass
                through every intermediate point between the two endpoints.

                The intermediate value theorem captures an intuitive property of continuous functions over the real numbers: given that \(\color{black}f\) is continuous over the interval \(\color{black}[1,3]\) with the known values
                \(\color{black}f(1)=3\) and \(\color{black}f(2)=6\), then the graph of \(\color{black}y=f(x)\) must pass through the horizontal line \(\color{black}y=4\) and \(\color{black}y=5\) while \(\color{black}x\) moves from 1 to 3
                according to the theorem. It represents the idea that the graph of a continuous function on a closed interval can be drawn without lifting a pencil from the paper.

            <p1>
                Limits are a fundamental concept in Calculus and mathematical analysis, used to determine the behavior of a function as the input variable approaches a specific value.
                they appear in the formal definition of derivatives, integrals, and Taylor series expansions. Limits are also used to study the behavior of functions near certain points, such as asymptotes, minima, maxima, and
                turning points, providing a clear understanding of the function in a neighborhood of the point. They are commonly alongside continuity, taught in an introductory-level Calculus course. Limits are used in other branches of
                mathematics such as Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Functional Analysis, and Differential Equations.
            </p1>

            <p1>Consider the function:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                \(\displaystyle \color{black}{f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}}\)
            </p1>

            <p1>
                At \(\color{black}x = 1\), \(\color{black}f(x)\) evaluates to an undefined expression.
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \color{black}{f(1) = \frac{1^2 - 1}{1 - 1}} = \frac{0}{0}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Such an expression gives no information about what is going on with the function nearby. We cannot determine the behavior of \(\color{black}f\) at \(\color{black}x = 1\) by ordinary methods. According to the graph of
                \(\color{black}f(x)\), there is a removable discontinuity &mdash;&mdash; a hole to be specific, at \(\color{black}x = 1\).
            </p1>
            <p1>To determine the function's behavior in this case, we can use the concept of limits.</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x\to 1}f(x) = 2}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>Although \(\color{black}f(x)\) is undefined at \(\color{black}x = 1\), applying the concept of limits lets us determine that it approaches 2 as \(\color{black}x\) approaches 1.</p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl2">Informal Definition of a Limit of a Function</p>
            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 3px;">
                In the informal definition of a limit, a function is said to have a limit \(\color{black}L\) at \(\color{black}c\) if it is possible to make the function arbitrary close to \(\color{black}L\) by choosing values of
                \(\color{black}x\) sufficiently close to \(\color{black}c\) but never reaching it at any finite point.
            </p1>
            <p1>
                Finding a limit entails understanding some real-valued function \(\color{black}{f(x)}\) behaves near a point at \(\color{black}c \in \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, \infty\}\). It will be useful to establish some notation. The
                expression 'the limit of \(\color{black}f\) as \(\color{black}x\) approaches \(\color{black}c\)' describes a number, often referred to as \(\color{black}L\) in mathematical writing, that the value \(\color{black}f\) nears as
                \(\color{black}x\) &mdash;&mdash; the independent variable, nears \(\color{black}c\). The general notation for the limit of a function can be written as
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax" style="font-size: 15px;">
                \(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x \to c}}\ f(x) = L\)
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Which is read as "the limit of function \(\color{black}f\) as \(\color{black}x\) approaches \(\color{black}c\) equals \(\color{black}L\)".
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Or alternatively written as
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax" style="font-size: 15px;">
                \(\displaystyle \color{black}{f(x) \rightarrow L \text{ as } x \rightarrow c}\)
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 6px;">
                Which is read as "\(\color{black}{f(x)}\) tends to \(\color{black}L\) as \(\color{black}x\) tends to \(\color{black}c\)".
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 9px;">
                There is a formal definition for limits called the <g>Epsilon-Delta Definition</g> or \(\color{black}(\epsilon,\ \delta)\) or \(\color{black}\epsilon \text{-}\)\(\color{black}\delta\), which is an algebraically precise
                formulation of evaluating the limit of a function. The informal definition is consistent with methods used to evaluate limits in elementary calculus, but the mathematically rigorous language associated with it appears in
                higher-level analysis. Every fact in mathematics must be rigorously proven from axioms and previously-established theorems. Every term must also have a clear, rigorous definition. See

                There will be cases where the limit of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) &mdash;&mdash; \(\color{black}L\), as \(\color{black}{x}\) approaches some value \(\color{black}{c}\), <i>does not exist</i>. The notation for a
                nonexistent limit is \(\color{black}{\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = \text{DNE}}\).
            </p1>
            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 3px;">The limit \(\color{black}L\) does not exist when any of the conditions listed below are true:</p1>

                    The one-sided limits are unequal: \(\color{black}{\lim_{x \to c^+}f(x) \neq \lim_{x \to c^-}f(x) \Rightarrow \lim_{x \to c}f(x) = \text{DNE}}\). See

                <li>
                    For a function whose values grow without bound, the function diverges and the usual limit does not exist. According to the formal definition of limits, infinite limits do not exist; the limit of real-valued functions
                    must be finite and a real number. \(\color{black}\infty\) just happens to be more informative rather than just \(\color{black}\text{DNE}\), so \(\color{black}L\) might be written as \(\color{black}{\pm \infty}\) rather
                    than \(\color{black}\text{DNE}\)
                </li>
                <li>\(\color{black}{f(x)}\) oscillates between two fixed values as \(\color{black}{x}\) approaches \(\color{black}c\)</li>

            <br />

            <p1>
                There is a case that arises when evaluating a limit, which are <i>indeterminate forms</i>. Indeterminate forms are undefined expressions that results from evaluating the limit via algebraic substitution. These sort of values
                does not reflect the actual limit of the function. Note that the adjective indeterminate does not imply that the limit does not exist. In many cases, algebraic elimination, L'HÃ´pital's rule, or other methods can be used to
                manipulate the expression so that the limit can be evaluated.<br />
                There are 7 indeterminate forms which are typically considered in mathematical literature:
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                \(\displaystyle \frac{0}{0},\ \frac{\infty}{\infty},\ 0 \times \infty,\ \infty - \infty,\ 0^0,\ 1^{\infty},\ {\infty}^0\)
            </p1>

            <p1>For example, consider the function \(\color{black}{f(x) = \Large \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}}\) and its limit as \(\color{black}x\) approaches 1:</p1>
            <p1 class="mathjax">
                \(\displaystyle \color{black}{\lim_{x\to 1}f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}}\)
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 4px;">
                If we were to evaluate this limit via algebraic substitution with the argument 1, \(\color{black}{f(x)}\) would evaluate to one of the seven indeterminate forms: \(\large \color{black}{\frac{0}{0}}\). This value does not
                reflect the actual limit of \(\color{black}{f(x)}\). Rather than algebraic substitution, other methods can be used to determine the actual limit.
            </p1>
            <p1>
                Not every undefined algebraic expression corresponds to an indeterminate form. For example, the expression \(\large \color{black}\frac{1}{0}\) is undefined as a real number but does not correspond to an indeterminate form;
                any defined limit that gives rise to this form will diverge to infinity.

            <p1>
                Evaluating the limit of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) means to find the limiting value \(\color{black}L\) as \(\color{black}x\) approaches \(\color{black}c\). Two possible values of \(\color{black}c\) are \(\color{black}c
                \in \mathbb{R}\) or is boundless: \(\color{black}\pm \infty\). There is no single uniform method of evaluating a limit. There are various methods of evaluating the limit of a function, and some are more advantageous than the
                other. The <span class="inline-toc-navigation" input type="button " onClick="document.getElementById('epsilon-delta-headline_lvl2').scrollIntoView()">limit laws</span> or properties are proven mathematical theorems that
                simplifies the process of evaluating a limit. For example, its proven that every polynomial function \(\color{black}p(x)\) is continuous over its entire domain, hence evaluating its limit is simple as directly
                substituting the value \(\color{black}c\) with the independent variable and solving. That is, \(\color{black}\lim_{x\to c}p(x) = p(c)\).

                We can conclude according to the table that for values of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> near 1, we have <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f(x)\)</span> near 2. The
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x = 1\)</span> row is in bold to highlight the fact that when considering limits, we are not concerned with the value of the function at that particular
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> value; we are only concerned with the values of the function when <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> is near 1. Hence:

            </p1>

            <p1>
                Although we could've gotten away with just one value of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span>, like <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x = 0.9999\)</span>, there is a possibility of the two-sided limit not existing
                (meaning the left-handed and right-handed values of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> does not converge on one particular value), hence you should always approach <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> to
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> from both sides to confirm the two-sided limit exists.

                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x = c\)</span> and locating the y-value where <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f\)</span> and <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x = c\)</span> intersects. Given you have some sort of graphing
                calculator, using graphs as the method to evaluate limits takes less effort, is reliable, and is less prone to human errors in algebraic calculations. You'd simply have to graph the function and visually evaluate the limit,
                which relatively takes minimal effort.

                According to the graph, a point discontinuation exists at <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f(1)\)</span>. Though if we pay no concern to that fact, we can see that as <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> approaches 1,
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(y\)</span> approaches 2. Hence:

                In cases where the functions is discontinuous at <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x = c\)</span> such as having an vertical asymptote or oscillates, then the limit of those functions as
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> might be any of the following possible values including: <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\infty\)</span>,

                Let <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> denote the value <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> approaches. The limit of a function can also be evaluated using multiple kinds of algebraic techniques, most of which
                more or less involves algebraically simplifying the function and substituting <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span>. Not sure whether the limit you got from using the algebraic techniques below is correct? See

            </p1>

            <p1 class="headline_lvl4">Direct Substitution</p1>

            <p1>
                One way to evaluate limits in general is by direct substitution. This should be the first method used prior to the other algebraic techniques. We can evaluate the limit by substituting the independent variable
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> with <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span>, then evaluating the algebraic expression.
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\( \displaystyle \color{black}{ \lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}} = f(1) \)</span><br />
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\;\;\;= \frac{1^2 - 1}{1 - 1} \)</span><br />
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\( \displaystyle \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\;\;\; = \frac{0}{0} \)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Direct substitution is not a reliable method to solve limits, as you face the possibility of the result being an indeterminate form as shown above. In all cases where substituting the independent variable with
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> results in an undefined expression, then it means the function has a discontinuity at that particular point. If direct substitution fails, we must try another algebraic technique to
                evaluate limits.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>If the limit is at infinity, that is,</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\( \displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Substituting <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> with <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\pm \infty\)</span> then evaluating isn't really defined. One way to approximate limits at infinity strictly by direct substitution
                is to approach <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> to extremely large values. Direct substitution is not a very reliable method to evaluate limits at infinity.
            </p1>

            <p1 class="headline_lvl4">Factoring</p1>
            <p1>
                You factor both the numerator and denominator if factorable, then simplify by cancelling the common factors. Substitute the independent variable <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> in the final expression with
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span>, then evaluate the algebraic expression.

                <g>L'HÃ´pital's rule</g> or <g>L'Hospital's rule</g> also known as Bernoulli's rule, is a theorem which provides a technique to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms resulting from direct substitutions, implying that
                L'Hospital's rule cannot be applied on a limit not of indeterminate form.<br />
                <br />

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 6px;">Given the function \(\large \color{black}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}\), L'HÃ´pital's rule is applicable if all the following conditions are satisfied:</p1>

            </p1>
            <p1>
                &bull; The rational function evaluates to either of the two indeterminate forms <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\large \frac{0}{0}\)</span> and <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\large \frac{\infty}{\infty}\)</span> via direct

            <p1>Otherwise applying L'HÃ´pital's rule will result in limits that are incorrect.</p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                In L'Hospital's rule, the differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be evaluated directly. There are cases where applying L'Hospital's rule once isn't
                enough, and requires further algebraic simplification and applications of L'Hospital's rule.

                For expressions where direct substitution evaluates to indeterminate forms other than <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> and <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\)</span> (such as
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(0^0\)</span> or <span class="MathJax_Display">\(0 \cdot \infty\)</span>, etc), then L'HÃ´pital's rule can only be applied by first applying the appropriate algebraic transformation (see table

                Algebraically transform it to the form <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \color{black}{\frac{f(x)}{1/g(x)}}\)</span> then take the limit of that form (which may require further algebraic simplification and

            <p1 class="headline_lvl4">Rationalization</p1>

            <p1>
                If you see a radical in an algebraic fraction expression, you should use rationalization to evaluate the limit. In elementary algebra, root rationalization is a process by which radicals in the denominator of an algebraic
                fraction are eliminated.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                If the denominator is a monomial in some radical, say <span class="MathJax_Display">\( {\displaystyle \color{black}{a{\sqrt[{n}]{x}}^{k}}} \)</span> with <span class="MathJax_Display">\(k < n\)</span>, rationalization
                consists of multiplying the numerator and the denominator by
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\({\displaystyle \color{black}{{\sqrt[{n}]{x}}^{n-k}}}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 4px;">
                If the denominator is linear in some square root, say <span class="MathJax_Display">\({\displaystyle \color{black}{a+b{\sqrt {x}}}}\)</span> rationalization consists of multiplying the numerator and the denominator by
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\({\displaystyle \color{black}{a-b{\sqrt {x}}}}\)</span> and expanding the product in the denominator.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                For example, the expression <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\)</span> being simplified to <span class="MathJax_Display">\(2\sqrt{5}\)</span> is the result of rationalization. Before delving more into
                rationalization, let's establish essential information. The conjugate of an expression of the form <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}{a + b\sqrt{d}}\)</span> is
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}{a - b\sqrt{d}}\)</span>. The conjugate has a property where:
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\( \displaystyle (\color{black}{a + b\sqrt{d}})(\color{black}{a - b\sqrt{d}}) = a^2 - db^2\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                We can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the numerator's conjugate. Then we cancel the common factors. Then we substitute <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> in the final
                expression with <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> and evaluate it.
            </p1>

            <p1>Consider the function:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{2 - \sqrt{x}}{4 - x}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>and we want to find the limit:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 4}f(x)\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Begin with multiplying the numerator and denominator by the numerator's conjugate.
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \frac{2 - \sqrt{x}}{4 - x} \times \frac{2 + \sqrt{x}}{2 + \sqrt{x}}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>Recall the conjugate property previously mentioned above.</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax"> <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle (2 - \sqrt{x})(2 + \sqrt{x}) = 2^2 - x\)</span> <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \, = 4 - x\)</span> </p1>

            <p1>Hence we have:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \frac{2 - \sqrt{x}}{4 - x} \times \frac{2 + \sqrt{x}}{2 + \sqrt{x}} = \frac{4 - x}{(4 - x)(2 + \sqrt{x})}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Cancel common factors.
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \frac{\cancel{4 - x}}{(\cancel{4 - x})(2 + \sqrt{x})} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{x}}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>Evaluate the limit by substituing <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> with <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> in the final expression.</p1>

            <p1>
                Let <span class="MathJax_Display">\(p(x)\)</span> be a polynomial function. Reminder, polynomials are expressions consisting of indeterminates and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction,
                multiplication, and positive-integer powers of indeterminates. Polynomials have the form:
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} +\ ...\ + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Where <span class="MathJax_Display">\(a_0\ ...\ a_n\)</span> are constants that are called the coefficients of the polynomial, and x is the indeterminate. <span class="MathJax_Display">\(5x^2 + 10x + 3\)</span> is a
                polynomial, while <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}\)</span> is not.
            </p1>

            <br />

            <p1>
                The limit of [a polynomial function] is equal to evaluating the polynomial function given the input value <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> (which is the value that
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> approaches in the limit). The rationale behind this property can be obtained by considering the continuity of all polynomial functions. You can conclude that <g>every</g> polynomial
                function is <i>continuous at every point</i>, hence evaluating its limit is as simple as direct substitution.

                A one-sided limit refers to either one of the two limits of a function \(\color{black}{f(x)}\) of a real variable \(\color{black}x \) as \( \color{black}x \) approaches a specified point either from the left or from the
                right. Practically speaking, when evaluating a left-hand limit, we consider only values of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> "to the left of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span>," i.e., where
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}{x < c}\)</span> . A similar statement holds for evaluating right-hand limits; there we consider only values of <span class="MathJax_Display">\( \color{black}x \)</span> to the
                right of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}c\)</span>, i.e., where <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}{x>c}\)</span>.

                It is possible for exactly one of the two one-sided limits to exist (while the other does not exist). It is also possible for neither of the two one-sided limits to exist. The limit as

                then <i>the limit</i> does not exist (or also the two-sided limit does not exist). In other words, we say <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}{f(x)}\)</span> has a limit

            <p class="headline_lvl3">Evaluating One-sided Limits</p>

            <p1>
                To evaluate one-sided limits graphically, we look at what value <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}x\)</span> approaches as <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}x\)</span> nears
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}c\)</span> on that particular side of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\color{black}c\)</span>. For example, considering the piecewise function:
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2 + 6 \quad 0 \leq x < 2 \\ \;\;\, x - 1 \quad\:\, 2 \leq x \leq 4\end{cases}\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>and we want to find the limits</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2^{^-}}f(x)\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2^+}f(x)\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>To evaluate these limits, look at the function's graph.</p1>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/onesided01.png" style="display: block; width: 33%; height: 33%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 30px;" />
                <figcaption class="figure_caption">Graph of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f(x)\)</span></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p1>
                According to the graph, the limit of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f(x)\)</span> as <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> approaches 2 from the left is 2. The limit of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f(x)\)</span> as
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span> approaches 2 from the right is 1. Hence the left-handed limit of <span class="MathJax_Display">\(f(x)\)</span> is 2 and the right-handed limit is 1.
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2^{^-}}f(x) = 2\)</span>

            <br />

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2^+}f(x) = 1\)</span>
            </p1>

            <p1>Incidentally, the one-sided limits are not equal hence the limit does not exist.</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2}f(x) = DNE\)</span>
            </p1>

            <br />
            <br />

            <p1>
                We can also numerically evaluate one-sided limits using tables. The left-handed limit can be evaluated by evaluating the limit as <span class="MathJax_Display">\(x\)</span>-values less than
                <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> approaches <span class="MathJax_Display">\(c\)</span> and similarly for right-handed limits.<br />
                Recall the limit from

            <h2 class="headline_lvl2" ; style="padding-top: 0;">Limits involving infinity</h2>

            <p1>
                Infinity is denoted by the symbol \(\color{black}\infty\) called the lemniscate. Infinity represents an idea of endlessness or an absence of any boundary or limitation, larger than any finite number. Time, for instance, is
                commonly seen as a continuous and unending progression of events, without a definite beginning or end. The concept of infinity can be applied to cardinalities of sets, such as the natural numbers. It can also be
                conceptualized as some arbitrarily large or unbounded quantity. The set of natural numbers is infinite, as it continues indefinitely without an end. This can be proven via contradiction; no matter how high you count, you can
                always add one more to reach a higher number.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">
                The lemniscate \(\color{black}\infty\) is used to represent an idea like "a function or sequence gets (and stays) greater than any finite positive number." For instance, we might say "the limit of \(\color{black}(1,4,9,16,\,
                ...)\) is \(\color{black}\infty\)" because the sequence stays above 100 after the tenth term, stays above 1000 after the 31\(^\text{st}\) term, etc. By logic, \(\color{black}-\infty\) can be used analogously to represent
                some unbounded arbitrary number less than any finite negative number. For example, \(\color{black}(16,13,8,1,-8,\, ...)\) might be said to have a limit of \(\color{black}-\infty\). \(\color{black}+\infty\) might be used to
                emphasize the disambiguation of positive infinity from negative infinity
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 7px;">
                An asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero but never intersects at any finite point. There are three kinds of asymptotes: <i>horizontal</i>, <i>vertical</i> and
                <i>oblique</i>. For curves given by the graph of a function \(\color{black}y = f(x)\), horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as x tends to \(+\infty\) or \(-\infty\). Vertical
                asymptotes are vertical lines near which the function grows without bound. An oblique asymptote has a slope that is non-zero but finite, such that the graph of the function approaches it as x tends to \(+\infty\) or
                \(-\infty\).
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 3px;">There is a connection between asymptotes and limits involving infinity.</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 7px;">
                The line \(\color{black}x = c\) is a vertical asymptote of the graph of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) if atleast one of the following statements is true:

            <ul class="list" id="list_">

                which in words, states that if either of the one-sided limits of \(\color{black}f(x)\) as \(\color{black}x\) approaches a value \(\color{black}c\) increases or decreases without bound &mdash;&mdash; \(\color{black}\pm
                \infty\), then \(\color{black}x = c\) is a vertical asymptote of the graph of \(\color{black}f(x)\)
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 3px;">
                The line \(\color{black}y = c\) is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) if atleast one of the following statements is true:

            <ul class="list" id="list_">

                <li>\(\displaystyle \color{black}\lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x) = c\)</li>

                which in words, states that if \(\color{black}f(x)\) approaches a limit \(\color{black}c\) as the variable \(\color{black}x\) increases or decrease without bound, there is a horizontal asymptote at \(\color{black}y= c\).
                This makes sense if one considers the geometric intuition behind these statements. For example, if you look at the end-behaviors of the graph \(1/x\), you'll notice that it diverges at the line \(y = 0\)

                When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the x- or y-axis, it is called an oblique asymptote or slant asymptote. A function \(\color{black}f(x)\) is asymptotic to the line defined by the equation \(\color{black}y = mx +

            <p1>
                In mathematics, differential calculus is a subfield of calculus that studies the rates at which quantities change &mdash;&mdash; the derivative. It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus, the other being
                integral calculus &mdash;&mdash; the study of the area beneath a curve.
            </p1>

            <p1>
                The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the derivative of a function, related notions such as the differential, and their applications. The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the
                rate of change of the function near that input value. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at
                that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point. For a real-valued function of a single real variable, the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best linear approximation
                to the function at that point. Differential calculus and integral calculus are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration.
            </p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl2" style="margin-top: 0;">Notation for differentiation</p>

            <p1>
                There is no single uniform notation for differentiation. Instead, various notations for the derivative of a function or variable have been proposed by various mathematicians. The usefulness of each notation varies with the
                context, and it is sometimes advantageous to use more than one notation in a given context. The more commonly used notations are Leibniz's and Lagrange's.
            </p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl3" style="margin-top: 0;">Leibniz's Notation for Differentiation</p>

            <p1>
                Leibniz's notation, named in honor of the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols \(\color{black}dy\) and \(\color{black}dx\) to represent infinitesimal increments of
                \(\color{black}y\) and \(\color{black}x\), respectively, just as \(\color{black}\Delta y\) and \(\color{black}\Delta x\) represent finite increments of \(\color{black}x\) and \(\color{black}y\), respectively.
            </p1>

            <p1>Suppose a dependent variable \(\color{black}y\) represents a function \(\color{black}f\) of an independent variable \(\color{black}x\), that is,</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(y = f(x)\)</p1>

            <p1>Then the derivative of the function \(\color{black}f\) with respect to \(\color{black}x\), in Leibniz's notation for differentiation, can be written as</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}\ \ \text{or}\ \ \frac{d}{dx}y\)</p1>

            <p1>
                The notation may also be thought of as an operator, operating on a function, which in the case above, is \(\color{black}y\). In its modern interpretation, the expression \(\large \color{black}\frac{dy}{dx}\) should not be
                read as the division of two infinitesimal quantities dx and dy (as Leibniz had envisioned it); rather, the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shorthand for
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax" style="margin-bottom: 0;">\(\displaystyle \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)</p1>
            <p1>(note \(\color{black} \Delta\) vs. \(\color{black}d\), where \(\color{black} \Delta\) indicates a infinite difference)</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">
                For an introductory-level Calculus course, it is sufficient to view this notation as no more than an operator, a syntatical device used to indicate the function of differentiation with respect to a variable.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 3px;">Furthermore the derivative of \(\color{black}f(x)\) can be written as:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{df}{dx}(x)\ \ \text{or}\ \ \frac{df(x)}{dx} \ \ \text{or}\ \ \frac{d}{dx}f(x)\)</p1>

            <p1>When this notation forms an equality, i.e.: </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)\)</p1>

            <p1>
                The equation can be read as "the derivative of \(\color{black}y\) with respect to \(\color{black}x\) is equal to \(\color{black}f(x)\). The expression on the right-hand side is the derivative of the function that is being
                differentiated, which is \(\color{black}y\) in the case above. For example, if \(\color{black}y = 2x + 1\), then \(\large\color{black}\normalsize\frac{dy}{dx} = 2\).
            </p1>
            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">Leibniz's notation for differentiation is analogous to the corresponding Lagrange's notations:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle f'(x)\ \ \text{or}\ \ y'\)</p1>

            <p1>The derivative of \(\color{black}f(x)\) at a point \(\color{black}x = c\) can be expressed in Leibniz's notation as</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\( \displaystyle \left. \frac{dy}{dx} \,\middle|\right. _{x \hspace{0.11em} =\, c} \quad \text{ or } \quad \frac{dy}{dx}(c)\)</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 6px;">
                Leibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). The derivative of a function \(\color{black}f(t)\) where \(\color{black}t\) is the dependent variable of \(\color{black}f\), can
                be expressed in Leibniz notation as:
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt}f(t)\)</p1>

            <p1>Which means to differentiate \(\color{black}f(t)\) in respect to \(\color{black}t\),</p1>
            <p1>
                or if \(\color{black}a = f(s)\) is a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables \(\color{black}a\) and \(\color{black}s\), then the derivative of \(\color{black}a\) with respect to \(\color{black}s\)
                can be expressed in Leibniz's notation as
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{da}{ds}\)</p1>

            <p1>Which means to differentiate \(\color{black}a\) with respect to \(\color{black}s\)</p1>

            <p1 class="headline_lvl4">Lebiniz's Notation for Higher-order Derivatives</p1>

            <p1>Given \(y = f(x)\), Lebiniz's notation for higher-order derivatives are written as</p1>

            <p1>The higher derivatives can be obtained inductively based on the expression above. So the second, third, fourth, and nth derivatives of \(\color{black}{f(x)}\) can be written as respectively:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{d^2y}{dx^2},\frac{d^3y}{dx^3},\frac{d^4y}{dx^4},\ ...\ ,\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}\)</p1>

                The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the
                function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the "instantaneous rate of change", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 6px;">
                In general terms, the derivative of a function is a measure of how rapidly a function's output changes relative to a change in the input value. The study of and calculation of derivatives is a large part of early calculus.
                Derivatives are important because they have many real world applications in areas such as engineering, economics, health care, and more. As a basic example, a function may model an object's position with respect to time; the
                derivative of that function at a specific point in time would provide the object's rate of change in position at that point in time (its velocity). Although this is only one general example, this use of the derivative alone
                can be applied to many real world problems.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 6px;">
                The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. The derivative of some function can be described as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a particular point ââ a real value, or as a
                function of said function. The derivative of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) as a function \(\color{black}f'(x)\) describes all derivatives of \(\color{black}f(x)\) at each point \(\color{black}x\) that are differentiable.
            </p1>

            <p1>The process of differentiation can be applied several times in succession, leading in particular to the second derivative fâ³ of the function f, which is just the derivative of the derivative fâ²</p1>

                Recall the concept of slopes. The slope is a numerical real-numbered value that describes the direction and steepness of a line in a linear equation \(\color{black}y = mx + b\). Slope may also be referred to as the average
                rate of change. The slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the change in \(\color{black}y\) and change in \(\color{black}x\) between two points.<br />
                The slope formula is expressed as:
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \color{black}m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\) </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 4px;">
                The slope formula can be generalized to an expression known as the difference quotient, whose result is a secant, measuring the average rate of change of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) over an interval \(\color{black}[x,\
                x+h]\) of length \(\color{black}h\).

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\)</p1>
            <p1>
                Choose two values \(\color{black}\{x,\ h\ |\ x \in \mathbb{R},\ h \in \mathbb{R}\}\). The two points involved in this expression \(\color{black}P_1 = (x + h,\ f(x + h))\) and \(\color{black}P_2 = (x,\ f(x))\), are analogous
                to \(\color{black}y_2\) and \(\color{black}y_1\) in the slope formula respectively. \(\color{black}h\) is the change in \(\color{black}x\) between \(\color{black}P_1\) and \(\color{black}P_2\). The difference of the function
                values \(\color{black}f(x + h)\) and \(\color{black}f(x)\) is divided by \(\color{black}h\); the result of this difference-quotient is the slope of the secant line that would intersect points \(\color{black}P_1\) and
                \(\color{black}P_2\).<br />
                If \(\color{black}h\) were to approach 0 but never reach it any finite point, the secant line would tend to a tangent; in other words, if points \(\color{black}P_1\) and \(\color{black}P_2\) were brought closer together,
                such that \(\color{black}h\) approaches 0, the secant line essentially becomes a tangent line. The slope of the forementioned tangent line is referred to as the derivative at that point, also referred to as the
                <i>instantaneous rate of change</i> of \(\color{black}f\) at \(\color{black}x\). This slope is <i>"</i>instantaneous<i>"</i> because it is the rate of change at a single moment in time, or at that particular instant, or at
                that very exact moment in time, rather than over a longer interval. This differs from a secant line because the secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point a and does not give an exact
                accounting for what happens between a and a + h.

            <p1 style="padding-top: 8px;">
                Now that we've established the rationale, the derivative of a real-valued function \(\color{black}f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) as a function \(\color{black}f'\) is defined as

                which is the limit of the difference quotient as \(\color{black}h\) approaches 0. \(\color{black}\Delta x\) might be used instead of \(\color{black}h\) in some mathematical literature to denote the change in
                \(\color{black}x\).

            <p1 style="padding-top: 3px;">
                The domain of \(\color{black}f'\) is the set of all points \(\color{black}c \in U\) for which the limit[the difference quotient as \(\color{black}h\) approaches 0] exists. \(\color{black}f'\) gives the derivative (the slope
                of the tangnet line) of \(\color{black}f\) at each point in the domain of \(\color{black}f\) for which the derivative is defined. If we define a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) for example, then the value
                \(\color{black}f'(2)\) represents the slope of the tangnet line at the point \(\color{black}(2, f(2))\) of the graph of \(\color{black}f\).

                Every differentiable function must also be continuous; if \(\color{black}f\) is differentiable at \(\color{black}x = c\), then \(\color{black}f\) must also be continuous at \(\color{black}x = c\)
            </p1>

            <p1>
                However, the converse of these two propositions does not hold; continuity does not imply differentiability. Consider the absolute value function \(\color{black}f(x) = |x|\) as an example. \(\color{black}f(x)\) is continuous
                but is not differentiable; although \(\color{black}f(x)\) is continuous at every point in its domain, its not differentiable at \(\color{black}x = 0\) since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left
                as they do from the right. \(\color{black}|x|\) has what is known as a cusp/corner. Continuous functions can have cusps, but not differentiable functions.

                The elementary rules of differentiation are the most basic and fundamental rules of differentiation in Calculus. The elementary rules of differentiation are fundamental because they apply to a wide variety of functions,
                including some of the most commonly used functions in calculus. These rules provide a starting point for finding the derivatives of more complicated functions, and they can be combined in various ways to find the derivatives
                of more complex expressions.

                <p1 style="padding-bottom: 8px;">
                    Compositions are common in typical looking functions. For example, the function \(\color{black}f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 9}\) is composition of the radical function \(\color{black}\sqrt{x}\) with a polynomial function
                    \(\color{black}x^2 + 9\); or that \(\color{black}f(x) = (2x + 1)^2\) is composition of the power function \(\color{black}x^2\) with a polynomial function \(\color{black}2x + 1\).
                </p1>

                <p1 style="padding-bottom: 3px;">The <i>chain rule</i> is a formula that expresses the derivative of the composition of two differentiable functions \(\color{black}f\) and \(\color{black}g\).</p1>

                <p1>If \(\color{black}h = f \circ g\) is the function such that \(\color{black}h(x) = f(g(x))\), then the chain rule, in Lagranage's notation, states that </p1>

                <p1 class="mathjax" style="vertical-align: 0;">\(\color{black}h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)\)</p1>

                <p1>or equivalently, in terms of function composition</p1>
                <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \color{black}(f \circ g)' = (f' \circ g) \cdot g'\)</p1>

                <p1>
                    The chain rule may also be expressed in Leibniz's notation. If a variable \(\color{black}z\) depends on the variable \(\color{black}y\), which itself depends on the variable \(\color{black}x\) (that is,
                    \(\color{black}y\) and \(\color{black}z\) are dependent variables), then \(\color{black}z\) depends on \(\color{black}x\) as well, via the intermediate variable y;
                </p1>
                <p1>this relationship can be expressed in function notation as \(\color{black} z = f(g(x))\) and \(\color{black}y = g(x)\). In this case, the chain rule is expressed as</p1>

                <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}\)</p1>

                <p1> </p1>

                <p1 style="padding-bottom: 4px;">
                    So the chain rule states that the derivative of a composition is [the derivative of the outer function(leaving the inner function unchanged and in place)] times [the derivative of the inner function].

                <p1>Note that when \(\color{black}a = e\), where \(\color{black}e\) is the base of the natural logarithm function, then</p1>
                <p1 class="mathjax" style="vertical-align: 0;">\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^x\right] = e^x\ln(e) = e^x\)</p1>

                    In other words, the derivative of the natural exponential function \(\color{black}e^x\) is itself: \(\color{black}e^x\). This is because after applying the exponential rule, we have the natural logarithm of
                    \(\color{black}e\), which is 1, and multiplying \(\color{black}e^x\) by 1 is just \(\color{black}e^x\)

                <p1 class="mathjax" style="vertical-align: 0;">\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}\)</p1>
                <p1>
                    This is because applying the logarithmic rule to the natural logarithm function results in \(\color{black}\ln(e)\) in the right-side of the formula, which is 1, and \(\color{black}1 \cdot x\) is just \(\color{black}x\)

                    If a real-valued function \(\color{black}f\) is continuous on the closed interval \(\color{black}[a, b]\), then \(\color{black}f\) must attain a maximum and a minimum, each at least once. That is, there exist numbers
                    \(\color{black}m\) and \(\color{black}M\) in \(\color{black}[a, b]\) such that:

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">
                its important to note that the theorem depends on two hypothesis, those being that \(\color{black}f(x)\) is continuous and that the interval is closed and bounded. If either of those conditions does not hold, then the
                theorem does not apply. It is also important to note the theorem states the maximum and minimum will occur at least once over the interval, not how to find them.

                The Mean Value Theorem (<i>abbr.</i> MVT), also known as Lagrange's mean value theorem (LMVT), is an existence theorem that provides a formal framework for a fairly intuitive statement relating change in a function to the
                behavior of its derivative. The theorem states that the derivative of a continuous and differentiable function must attain the function's average rate of change (in a given interval). For a physical intuition, if a car
                travels 100 miles in 2 hours, then it must have had the exact speed of 50 mph at some point in time.

                Simple-sounding as it is, the mean value theorem actually lies at the heart of the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus, and is itself based ultimately on properties of the real numbers.

                <p1>
                    The theorem states that if a real-valued function \(\color{black}f\) is continuous on the closed interval \(\color{black}[a,b]\) and differentiable on the open interval \(\color{black}(a,b)\), then there exists some

                Geometrically, the left-hand side of the MVT represents the slope of the tangent line to \(\color{black}f(x)\) at \(\color{black}x=c\), and the right-hand side as the slope of the secant line connecting the points
                \(\color{black}(a,f(a))\) and \(\color{black}(b,f(b))\); in other words, the left-hand side is the derivative of \(\color{black}f\) at a point \(\color{black}c\), and the right-hand side is the slope of the secant line.
            </p1>
            <p1>Conceptually, the left-hand side represents the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at x=c while the right-hand side represents the average rate of change of f(x) over the interval from x=a to x=b</p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl2" style="margin-top: 0; clear: both;">Logarithmic Differentiation</p>

            <p1><i>Logarithmic differentiation</i> or <i>differentiation by taking logarithms</i> is a method used to differentiate functions by employing the logarithmic derivative of a function.</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 6px;">Following the chain rule, the logarithmic derivative of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) is defined as</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle [\ln(f(x))]' = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \)</p1>

            <p1>Isolating \(\color{black}f'(x)\) in the right side, the general logarithmic differentiation formula is defined as</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(f'(x) = f(x) \cdot [\, \ln(f(x))\,]'\)</p1>

            <p1>
                The technique is often performed in cases where it is easier to differentiate the logarithm of a function rather than the function itself. This usually occurs in cases where the function of interest is composed of a product,
                is a quotient of two functions, or is a function raised to a function &mdash;&mdash; so that a logarithmic transformation will turn it into separate parts (which is much easier to differentiate).
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">
                The method is used because the properties of logarithms provide avenues to quickly simplify complicated functions to be differentiated. These properties are manipulated after the taking of natural logarithms on both sides
                and before the preliminary differentiation.

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Instead of explicitly differentiating this "function", we can implicitly differentiate it.</b></p1>

            <p1>
                <i>Implicit Differentiation</i> is the process of differentiating implicit functions or equations. Implicit functions are written in the form \(\color{black}f(x, y) = 0\). Some implicit functions can be converted to the
                conventional form \(\color{black}y = f(x)\) so that it can be explicitly differentiated, which usually involves algebraically isolating \(\color{black}y\). However, implicitly differentiating is often more advantageous as
                there are cases where the original equation cannot be solved explicitly and conversion to \(\color{black}y = f(x)\) is not possible &mdash;&mdash; and that the derivative resulting from implicit differentiation is generally
                simpler and easier to use.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 4px;">Some examples of implicit equations are:</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">
                \( \begin{aligned}& x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\[5px] & x^3 + y^3 = 3xy \\[5px] & 3y^2 + 2x^3 = 9x \\[5px] & x^2(x^2 + y^2) = y^2 \\[5px] \end{aligned} \)
            </p1>

            <p1>
                To differentiate implicitly defined functions, we make the assumption that \(\color{black}y\) is an unspecified function of \(\color{black}x\) and in most cases, we employ the chain rule with \(\color{black}y\) as the inner
                function. In the case of \(\color{black}y^2\), we can interpret it as a composite function \(\color{black}f \circ g\), where \(\color{black}f(x) = x^2\) and \(\color{black}g(x) = y(x)\), and apply the chain rule from there.
                For something plain like \(\color{black}y\), the derivative is notated as \(\color{black}y'x)\).
            </p1>

            <p1>The chain rule is a differentiation rule that expresses the derivative of the composition of two differentiable functions \(\color{black}f\) and and \(\color{black}g\). It states that</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 7px;">
                The graph of a function \(\color{black}f\) is concave upward on an open interval \(\color{black}(a,\ b)\) if \(\color{black}f'\) is an increasing function, \(\color{black}f'(x) > 0\) that is, on \(\color{black}(a,b)\).

                The graph of a function \(\color{black}f\) is concave downward on an open interval \(\color{black}(a,\ b)\) if \(\color{black}f'\) is a decreasing function, \(\color{black}f'(x) < 0\) that is, on \(\color{black}(a,b)\).
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 7px;">
                If \(\color{black}f\) is twice differentiable on an interval \(\color{black}(a,\ b)\), then the graph of \(\color{black}f\) is concave upward on \(\color{black}(a,\ b)\) if \(\color{black}f''(x) > 0\) for all
                \(\color{black}x\) in \(\color{black}(a,\ b)\), and concave downward on \(\color{black}(a,\ b)\) if \(\color{black}f''(x) < 0\) for all \(\color{black}x\) in \(\color{black}(a,\ b)\).

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
                Concavity is referring to how the tangential slope of a function behaves. The second derivative \(\color{black}f''(x)\) is used to measure how the rate of change of a quantity is itself changing, which is
                \(\color{black}f'(x)\) in this case.

            <p class="headline_lvl1">Antiderivative</p>

            <p1>
                An antiderivative, inverse derivative, primitive function, primitive integral or indefinite integral of a function \(\color{black}f\) is a differentiable function \(\color{black}F\) whose derivative is equal to the original
                function f. This can be stated symbolically as F' = f. The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration), and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the
                process of finding a derivative. This should not be confused with the term integration. Capital Roman letters such as \(\color{black}F\) and \(\color{black}G\) are often used to defined .
            </p1>

            <p1>The general form of an antiderivative is written using the integral symbol with no bounds</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\color{black}\displaystyle \int f(x) \, dx\)</p1>
            <p1>
                There are infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function \(\color{black}f\). These antiderivatives differ from each other by a constant, called the constant of integration. The symbol \(\color{black}C\) (or
                \(\color{black}c\)) is typically used to denote this arbitrary constant of integration.
            </p1>

            <p1>
                The constant of integration is a constant term added to an antiderivative of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) to indicate that the antiderivative of \(\color{black}f(x)\) (i.e., the set of all antiderivatives of
                \(\color{black}f(x)\)), is only defined up to an additive constant. The constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 3px;">
                More specifically, if \(\color{black}F(x)\) is an antiderivative of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\), then the set of all antiderivatives of \(\color{black}f(x)\) is given by the functions \(\color{black}F(x) + C\), where
                \(\color{black}C\) is an arbitrary constant (meaning that any value of \(\color{black}C\) would make \(\color{black}F(x)+C\) a valid antiderivative). For that reason, the indefinite integral is often written as
            </p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \int f(x)\,dx=F(x)+C\)</p1>

            <p1>The set of all antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other, with each graph's vertical location depending upon the value \(\color{black}C\).</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 10px;">
                There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Such functions are referred to as nonelementary antiderivatives or nonelementary integrals. Even
                if it is not possible to evaluate an antiderivative in elementary terms, one can always approximate a corresponding definite integral by numerical integration methods such as the Riemann Sums.

            <p class="headline_lvl1">Integral</p>

            <p1>
                Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operations of calculus, the other being differentiation. Integration started as a method to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as
                calculating areas, volumes, and their generalizations, or determining displacement from velocity.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 6px;">
                The integrals enumerated in this section are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the <g>net signed</g> area of a region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function over an interval,
                or interpreted as the accumulated sum of the function's values changing over time.
            </p1>

            <p1>
                Besides definite integrals, integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative or indefinite integrals, a function whose derivative is the given function. Whether the term "integral" refers to the definite or
                indefinite integral will vary in context, but will typically refer to the definite integral.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 6px;">
                Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of definite integration were formulated independently by mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the
                late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that
                approximates the area of a region by breaking the region into infinitesimally thin vertical rectangles. In the early 20th century, Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann's formulation by introducing what is now referred to as
                the Lebesgue integral; it is more robust than Riemann's in the sense that a wider class of functions are Lebesgue-integrable.
            </p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl2">Notation</p>

            <p1>The modern notation for integration follows from Leibniz's notes; the symbol of integration \( \int\), was based on the Å¿ (elongated s) character and was chosen to suggest summation ("S" in "sum").</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">In general, the definite integral of a real-valued function \(\color{black}{f(x)}\) with respect to a real variable \(\color{black}x\) on an interval \(\color{black}{[a, b]}\) is written as</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\ dx\)</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-bottom: 5px;"> and is read as <i>"</i>the integral of \(\color{black}f(x)\) with respect to \(\color{black}x\), from \(\color{black}a\) to \(\color{black}b\)<i>"</i>, though this may vary slightly.</p1>

            <p1>
                The function \(\color{black}{f(x)}\) is called the integrand, the points \(\color{black}a\) and \(\color{black}b\) are called the limits (or bounds) of integration, and the integral is said to be over the interval
                \(\color{black}{[a, b]}\), called the interval of integration. The symbol \(\color{black}dx\), called the differential of the variable \(\color{black}x\), indicates that the variable of integration is \(\color{black}x\); it
                is sufficient to interpret \(\color{black}dx\) as a syntatical device that is paired with an integral expression to indicate the variable of integration &mdash;&mdash; rather than assigning it some special meaning. A
                function is said to be integrable if its integral over its domain is finite.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">When the limits are omitted, as in</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \int f(x)\ dx\)</p1>

            <p1>the integral is called an indefinite integral or antiderivative.</p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl2">Formal Definitions</p>

            <p1>
                net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero. If the area above the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is positive. If the area below the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is negative. If the areas above and
                below the x-axis are equal, they cancel out and the net signed area is zero.
            </p1>

            <p1>regions above the x-axis have positive area, while regions below the x-axis have negative area.</p1>

            <p1>The value of a definite integral over an interval represents the net signed area under a curve bounded by the function over the forementioned interval, and this area is a geometric quantity that is always a real number.</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 7px;">
                There are many ways of formally defining an definite integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also
                occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals, where the former is typically taught in an introductory-level Calculus course, contrary to the latter.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 3px;">
                The Riemann integral is the simplest integral to define, and it allows one to integrate every continuous function as well as some not-too-badly discontinuous functions. The Lebesgue integral extends the definition of the
                integral, allowing one to integrate a much broader class of functions.
            </p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl3">Riemann Integral</p>

            <p1>
                A Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. The Riemann sum is calculated by partitioning the region into shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas, or cubics) that together form a region
                that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all of these small areas together.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">
                Because the region by the small shapes is usually not exactly the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured. This error margin can be reduced by dividing up the region
                more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the Riemann integral. Loosely speaking, the Riemann integral is the limit of the Riemann sums of a function as the
                partitions get finer. If the forementioned limit exists then the function is said to be integrable over that interval (or more specifically Riemann-integrable). The Riemann sum can be made as close as desired to the Riemann
                integral by making the partition fine enough.
            </p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl4">Riemann Sums</p>

            <p1>
                A summation is the addition of a sequence of terms. These terms can be functions, vectors, matrices, polynomials, and in general, elements of any type of mathematical objects on which an operation "+" is defined. The result
                is their sum or total.

                subinterval is equal.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 4px;">
                A Riemann sum can be visualized as a division of (approximately) the area under the curve \(\color{black}f(x)\) on \(\color{black}[a,b]\) into \(\color{black}n\) adjacent rectangles spanning the interval, where the
                \(\color{black}k\)th rectangle has width \(\color{black}\Delta x_k\) and height \(\color{black}f(c_k)\). The area of each rectangle is \(\color{black}f(c_k)\Delta x_k\) (height times width). The summation of the areas of all
                rectangles approximates the actual area under \(\color{black}f\) on \(\color{black}[a,b]\) and is equal to the Riemann sum.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 6px;">
                The Riemann summations are usually best approached with subintervals of equal size. By choosing points within each subinterval in a uniform manner rather than arbitrarily, so that the subintervals are equal in length, we can
                reduce the computational complexity of the Riemann Sum and allow us to compute the Riemann Sums in a easy systematic way. Assuming the function is Riemann integrable, it does not matter in the end whether the partitions are
                uniform are not, because they will converge to the Riemann Sum as long as the width of each subinterval approaches 0.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 3px;">Hence, the intervals <i>mentioned in this section</i> will be divided into \(\color{black}n\) subintervals, each of length</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n}\)</p1>

            <p1>The points in the partition will then be</p1>

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(a,\ a + \Delta x,\ a + 2\Delta x,\ ...,\ a + (n - 2)\Delta x,\ a + (n - 1)\Delta x,\ b\)</p1>

            <p1>
                Because the region by the small shapes is usually not exactly the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured, either being an overestimation or underestimation of the
                actual signed area under the curve. This error can be reduced by dividing up the region more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the Riemann integral.
            </p1>

            <p1>The approximation becomes more accurate as the resolution of the partition increases. \(\color{black}\Delta x\) &mdash; the width of the partitions, will decrease as the amount of partitions \(\color{black}n\) increase.</p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl3">Second Part</p>

            <p1>The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute a definite integral when the antiderivative of its integrand is known.</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 4px;">
                Let \(\color{black}f\) be a real-valued function on a closed interval \(\color{black}[a, b]\) and \(\color{black}F\) a continuous function on \(\color{black}[a, b]\) and an antiderivative of \(\color{black}f\), such that

            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \color{black}F'(x) = f(x) \quad \text{ or } \quad F(x) = \int f(x) + C\)</p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 9px;">
                For example, if \(\color{black}f(x) = x^2\) and \(\color{black}F = \color{black}\large\frac{x^3 \normalsize}{3}\), then the process of evaluating the definite integral of \(\color{black}f(x)\) on the interval
                \(\color{black}[0, 8]\) is as follows:

            <p1>So in conclusion,</p1>

                Despite their equivalancy, the first expression is more than simple than the second one. As illustrated in the example, it is clear that the decision of choosing which function to assign as \(\color{black}u\) or
                \(\color{black}dv\) can turn out advantageous, computation-wise. Hence, the mnemonic acronym "LIATE," is introduced.

            <p1>The function which is to be \(\color{black}dv\) is whichever comes last in the list. The reason is wthat functions lower on the list generally have easier antiderivatives than the functions above them.</p1>

                Logarithmic functions obtained through integration should have their argument wrapped in absolute value enclosures, e.g. log(|...|) or ln(|...|). This is because the domain of logarithmic functions is restricted to positive
                real numbers. This isn't necessarily the case for the domain of the integrand.

            <p class="headline_lvl2">Improper Integral</p>

            <p1>
                The concept of improper integrals serves the purpose of providing a method to integrate functions that are not integrable in the conventional sense (as a Riemann integral, for instance) due to unbounded domains, singularies, and other kinds of discontinuities. While an improper integral is typically written symbolically just like a standard definite integral, it can be rewritten to represent a limit of a definite integral or a sum of such limits. This is done to extend the definition of integrals that would otherwise, not meet the required circumstances to be integrable (in the sense of Riemann for example). As a consequence, the concept of convergence is introduced, where an improper integral is said to be convergent or to converge if the limit(s) defining it exists(and finite); otherwise, the integral is said to be divergent or to diverge.

            <p1>The first three cases where the intervals are unbounded, cover what are sometimes known as improper integrals of the first type or kind; integrals in case 4 that are improper because of vertical asymptotes are of the "second" type or kind; and cases which combine aspects of both types are sometimes described as being of the "third" kind.</p1>

            <p1 style = "padding-top: 5px">A limitation of the technique of improper integration is that the limit of an integral must be taken with respect to only one of its endpoint at a time. Thus, in the third case and last two subcases of the fourth case, the improper integral is redefined as the summation of two seperate limits of two distinct improper integrals of the first kind. These two limits must both exist (be convergent) for the improper integral as a whole to be convergent or to converge. If either of the two limits is divergent, then so is this improper integral.</p1>

            <p1 style = "padding-top: 5px">Let's clarify the way the improper integral is rewritten in subcases of the fourth case; the variables \(\color{black}s\) and \(\color{black}t\) tends to the endpoint from the interior of the interval; it might happen that an integrand is discontinuous near an interior point rather than an endpoint, in which case the integral must be split at that point as shown in the fourth subcase</p1>

            <p class="headline_lvl3">Examples</p>

            <p1>
                The original definition of the Riemann integral does not apply to a function such as \(\color{black}\frac{1}{x^2}\) on the interval \(\color{black}[1, \infty)\), because in this case the interval of integration is unbounded.
            </p1>

            <p1>
                The narrow definition of the Riemann integral also does not cover the function \(\color{black}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\) on the interval \(\color{black}[0, 1]\). The problem here is that the integrand has an asymptotic behaviour
                and thus is unbounded in the interval of integration.

            <p1>
                Let's define the mean of a function over an interval as a requisite to understand the Mean Value Theorem. The mean of a function \(\color{black}f(x)\) over an interval \(\color{black}I = [a,b]\) is the accumulated sum of the values of
                \(\color{black}f(x)\) over \(\color{black}I\), divided by the length of \(\color{black}I\). The accumulated sum of the values of \(\color{black}f(x)\) can be found by taking the definite integral of \(\color{black}f(x)\).
                The length of \(\color{black}I\) can be found by subtracting its upper endpoint by its lower endpoint, i.e. \(\color{black}b - a\).
            </p1>

            <p1>So the mean value of \(\color{black}f(x)\) on an interval \(\color{black}[a,b]\) can be defined as</p1>
            <p1 class="mathjax">\(\displaystyle \frac{1}{b-a}\int^b_a f(x) \, dx.\)</p1>

            <p1>In a way, this is analogous to the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean is the accumulated sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.</p1>

            <p1>A sequence is formally defined as a function whose domain is an interval of integers. The definition in this section will cover real-valued sequences. Note that the codomain does not necessarily have to be the set of real numbers, as it can also be the set of complex numbers for example.</p1>

            <p1 style = "padding-top:10px">A real-valued sequence is a function whose domain is an interval of integers \(\color{black} \{n_0,\, n_{0+1},\, n_{0+2},\, \ldots\}\) and whose codomain is a subset of the real numbers.</p1>

            </p1>

            <p1>Authors may use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of natural numbers \(\color{black}\mathbb{N}\). For example, suppose that the domain of a sequence is the set of natural numbers \(\color{black}\mathbb{N}\) and the sequence maps each natural number to two times itself.</p1>

            <p1>Although sequences are formally defined as a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, that is, \(\color{black}a_n\) rather than \(\color{black}a(n)\). There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the lowest input (often 1) is called the "first element" of the sequence, the value at the second smallest input (often 2) is called the "second element", etc. Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. \(\color{black}f\), a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as \(\color{black}(a_{n})_{n\in S}\), or just as \(\color{black}(a_{n})\). Then for each \(\color{black}n \in S\), \(\color{black}f(n)\) is denoted \(\color{black}a_n\). Here \(\color{black}S\) is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.</p1>

            <p class = "headline_lvl2">Notation</p>

            <p1>The ellipsis \(\color{black}...\) is used when the sequence pattern can be deduced based on the explicitly listed terms of the sequence. </p1>

            <p1 style = "padding-top: 10px"> There are a number of ways to denote a sequence. One way to denote a finite sequence is to seperate each individual term by a comma, all enclosed in parantheses\(\color{black}()\) or curly brackets\(\color{black}\{\}\). For instance, \(\color{black}(1, 2, 3, 4)\), which can be read as "one, two, three, four," or \(\color{black}(1, 2, 3,\, \ldots, 6)\), which can be read as "one, two, three, and so on until 6." Infinite sequences are composed in a similar way, but with the exception that an ellpsis is explicitly substituted for the terminal segment of the sequence to indicate an unlimited sequence of terms. For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers is written as \(\color{black}(1, 3, 5, 7,\, \ldots)\)</p1>

            <p1 style = "padding-top: 10px">Another way is to begin with writing a general formula for computing the \(\color{black}n\)th term as a function of \(\color{black}n\), enclose it in parantheses, curly brackets, or triangular brackets and appending a subscript to indicate the set of values that indexes the sequence. In a case where the indexing set of a sequence is the set of natural numbers \(\color{black}\mathbb{N}\) for example, then the sequence is indexed by non-negative integers. For example, the infinite sequence of even numbers can be denoted as \(\color{black}(2n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\). The infinite sequence of squares can be denoted as \(\color{black}(n^2)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\). Other brackets can be used, such as \(\{n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) or \(\langle n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\)</p1>

            <p1 style = "padding-top: 5px">This notation is often combined with the technique of treating the terms of a sequence as individual variables. This yields expressions like \(\displaystyle \color{black}  (a_n)_{n \mkern 1mu \in \mkern 1mu \mathbb{N}} \), which denotes a sequence whose \(\color{black}n\)th element is given by the variable \(\color{black}a_{n}\).</p1>

            <p1 class = "mathjax">
            \(\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{1}&amp;=1{\text{st element of }}(a_n)_{n \mkern 1mu \in \mkern 1mu \mathbb{N}}\\a_{2}&amp;=2{\text{nd element of }}(a_n)_{n \mkern 1mu \in \mkern 1mu \mathbb{N}} \\a_{3}&amp;=3{\text{rd element of }}(a_n)_{n \mkern 1mu \in \mkern 1mu \mathbb{N}} \\&amp;\;\;\vdots \\a_{n-1}&amp;=(n-1){\text{th element}}\\a_{n}&amp;=n{\text{th element}}\\a_{n+1}&amp;=(n+1){\text{th element}}\\&amp;\;\;\vdots \end{aligned}}\)
            </p1>

            <p1>An alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values. \(\color{black}(a_k)^n_{k = i}\) means the list of terms in the sequence \(\color{black}a_k\), ranging from \(\color{black}k = i\) to \(\color{black}k = n\); i.e.:</p1>

            <p1 class = "mathjax">\(\color{black}(a_k)^n_{k = i} = (a_i,\, a_{i + 1}\, a_{i + 2}\, \ldots, a_n)\)</p1>

            <p1>For example, \(\color{black}(k^2)^{10}_{k = 1}\) denotes the ten-term sequence of squares \(\color{black}(1, 4, 9, \ldots, 100)\).</p1>

            <p1 style = "padding-top: 10px">In cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often omitted. That is, one simply writes \(\color{black}(a_{n})\) or \(\color{black}\{a_{n}\}\) for an arbitrary sequence. When a sequence is indexed by natural numbers, zero-based indexing or one-based indexing.</p1>

            <p1 class = "mathjax">\(\color{black} (a_n)^\infty_{n = 1} = (a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = (a_1, a_2, a_3,\, \ldots)\)</p1>

            <p1>Any ordered infinite sequence \(\color{black}(a_1,\, a_2,\, a_3,\, \ldots)\) of terms (that is, numbers, functions, or any mathematical object where the operation addition is defined) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the ai one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an infinite series. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an expression like</p1>

            <p1 class = mathjax>\(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots\)</p1>

                symbol means that the initial index starts out as \(m\). The index, \(i\), is incremented by one for each successive term, stopping when \(i = n\). It is an iterated operation that is an extension of the addition operation

            <p1>The \(\color{black}n\)th partial sum \(\color{black}S_n\) is the sum of the first \(\color{black}n\) terms of the sequence. One significance of partial sums is to provide a way to examine the convergence or divergence of a series, a process known as a convergence test.</p1>

            <p1 class = "mathjax">\(\displaystyle S_n = \sum^n_{k = 1}a_k = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n\)</p1>

            <p1>The partial summation of a sequence themselves form a sequence \(\color{black}(S_N)_{N \in N}\). A series is said to be convergent or to converge if the sequence of partial sums converges to a finite limit as the number of terms increases. In the case where a series is convergent, there exists a number that is called the sum or value of the series. Otherwise, if the partial sums grow without bound, the series is said to be divergent or to diverge. For example, the partial sums of a geometric series with a common ratio of 1/2 converges to the value 2.</p1>

            <p1>Consider the sequence \(\color{black}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\). The partial sums of this sequence would be:</p1>


            <p1 class = "mathjax">\(\begin{align}
            & S_1 = 1 \quad\quad && \text{(sum of the first term)} \\
            & S_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 && \text{(sum of the first two terms)} \\
            & S_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 && \text{(sum of the first three terms)} \\ 
            & S_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 && \text{(sum of the first four terms)} \\
            & S_5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 && \text{(sum of all the terms)}\end{align}\)</p1>


            <p1>So, the partial sums provide a way to observe the cumulative sum of the terms as we progress through the sequence.</p1>

            <p1>
                A differential equation (abbrev. DE) is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives. Similar to algebraic equations, where you are to find its solutions that fullfill the condition stated by the
                equation (e.g., 2x + 4 = 8; x = 2), the study of differential equations consists of the study of their solutions (the set of functions that satisfy each equation).
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">
                Differential equations can be classified into several types.
                <!-- include order of DE-->Apart from describing the properties of the equation itself, these classes of differential equations can help inform the choice of approach to a solution. Commonly used distinctions include whether
                the equation is ordinary or partial, linear or non-linear, and homogeneous or heterogeneous. This list is far from exhaustive; there are many other properties and subclasses of differential equations which can be very useful
                in specific contexts.
            </p1>

            <p1 style="padding-top: 5px;">
                The order of the differential equation is the highest order of derivative of the unknown function that appears in the differential equation. For example, an equation containing only first-order derivatives is a first-order
                differential equation, an equation containing the second-order derivative is a second-order differential equation, and so on.
